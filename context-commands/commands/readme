1.) Keywords with special meaning
- dimension    ->   value is a TeX-dimension
- command      ->   value is a TeX-command

2.) Macros with special meaning
- \cmd{} make reference to other command

3.) Comment and description
Perhaps the following general rule is useful:
- when you want to describe something (command, variant, option,
  keyword, setting, etc), then begin with a short "comment"
- when more text is needed, then provide a "description"

4.) Categories
First category is main category, in the other categories, there are
just references.
