1.) Keywords with special meaning
- values in settings:
  - dimension    ->   value is a TeX-dimension
  - number       ->   value is a real number
  - command      ->   value is a TeX-command
- status:
  - draft        ->   still work in progress
  - final        ->   a context-expert has approuved the cid-file, it's now in
                      sync with the latest context-version

2.) Macros with special meaning
- \cmd{} make reference to other command

3.) Comment and description
Perhaps the following general rule is useful:
- when you want to describe something (command, variant, option,
  keyword, setting, etc), then begin with a short "comment"
- when more text is needed, then provide a "description"

4.) Categories
First category is main category, in the other categories, there are
just references.
