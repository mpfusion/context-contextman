Introduction
------------

The ideas behind this project can be found in history/context-reference.pdf.
The ctx-ref.cld shows, what can be done quite easily with the cid-files
(cid = context interface description).

Some threads in public mailing lists:

Roadmap
-------

1. Transform cont-en.xml to cid-files without information loss.
- That means also, to add more argument types.
- I've no experience with xml, but I'm willing to do that, if nobody else
  does. I hope to get help from the x-set-12.mkiv file. (-- Peter)
- Before doing that, we should ask Hans for feedback. He should feel
  comfortable with the cid-files.

2. Update ctx-ref.cld.
- It should treat all kinds of commands and arguments.
- Some cleanup.

3. Integrate all information from the wiki.
- Only mkiv.
- Verify before integration.
- No deprecated commands.

4. context --mode=html ctx-ref.cld
- Then put the files on a web-server.
- Think about best integration with the wiki.

5. Complete description of all commands.
- Just some few hundreds commands to describe...
- And all arguments of course!


Description of the files and directories
----------------------------------------
commands:          One file per command (or environment)
Makefile:          main entry point for creation of pdf and html files
definitions.cid:   collection of keywords and settings, that can be inherited
                   by any command (-> resolve)
history:           initial presentation at the ConTeXt meeting 2010
categories.lua:    structure of the categories
e-ctx-ref.tex:     settings for the pdf-output (style-file)
ctx-ref.cld:       lua functions for pdf-creation


Some unordered todo-items
-------------------------

- How to manage examples?
  - external tex-files
  - example types: inline, tex-page, source + output side by side, etc.
  - perhaps no example at all: examples are for the context-manual,
    let's keep this reference dry, just for look-ups
- Import cid-files from third party modules.
- Perhaps support main-categories and sub-categories.
- more nice colors
- More compact layout, better stylesheet
- Perhaps 2-column layout
- A much better ctx-ref.cld (today just quick hacks...)
- \cmd{} (cross-referencing)
- titlepage
- index
- no need for variants = {} when there is only one variant (automatic in cld)
- use "fixpart", "varpart", "generator"
- use "default" values
- use "inherit" with cross-links
- perhaps "inherit" should list the keywords/settings recursively?
