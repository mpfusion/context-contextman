- How to manage examples?
    - external tex-files
    - example types: inline, tex-page, source + output side by side, etc.

- Import cid-files from third party modules.

- Perhaps support main-categories and sub-categories.

- Nice colors in output.

- More compact output, better stylesheet.

- A much better ctx-ref.cld (today just quick hacks...)
