- How to manage examples?
  - external tex-files
  - example types: inline, tex-page, source + output side by side, etc.
  - perhaps no example at all: examples are for the context-manual,
    let's keep this reference dry, just for look-ups
- Import cid-files from third party modules.
- Perhaps support main-categories and sub-categories.
- more nice colors
- More compact layout, better stylesheet
- Perhaps 2-column layout
- A much better ctx-ref.cld (today just quick hacks...)
- \cmd{} (cross-referencing)
- titlepage
- index
- no need for variants = {} when there is only one variant (automatic in cld)
