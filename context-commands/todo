- How to manage examples?
    - external tex-files
    - example types: inline, tex-page, source + output side by side, etc.

- Import cid-files from third party modules.

- Perhaps support main-categories and sub-categories.

- Nice colors in output.

- More compact layout, better stylesheet

- Perhaps 2-column layout

- A much better ctx-ref.cld (today just quick hacks...)

- Perhaps call-back functions like
  general_keywords()
  general_settings()
  ???  (dropped in commit 301)
