Zwarte Water. The bishop of Utrecht gave Hasselt his consent

\blank
Other cities in the neighbourhood of Hasselt were afraid of the
toll money to be paid when crossing this bridge so they
prevented the construction for many years.
\stopframedtext
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer

This example also illustrates the command
\type{\definefloat}. You can find more information
on this command in \in{paragraph}[textblocks]. The
\type{\blank} is necessary to enforce a blank line.
