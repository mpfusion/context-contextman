When \CONTEXT\ is run a number of predefined parameters is
loaded. These parameters are set up in the file
\type{cont-sys.tex}. Users can define their own preferences
(housestyle) in this file. Be aware of the fact that
\CONTEXT\ has to be able to find this file. The
\type{readme} file that goes with the distribution tells
some more about site specific setups. The most important
addition to this file probbably concerns the output:

\starttyping
\setupoutput[pdftex]
\stoptyping

tells \CONTEXT\ to produce \PDF\ output instead of \DVI,
while

\starttyping
\setupoutput[dvipsone,dviwindo]
\stoptyping

sets things up for those programs. By default \DVIPS\ output
is set up.
