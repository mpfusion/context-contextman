Hasselt is an old Hanseatic City, situated 12~km north of Zwolle at
the river Zwartewater.

The city has a long history since obtaining the city charter around
1252. Part and parcel of this history can be traced back to a large
number of monuments to be admired in the city center.

There you will find the St. Stephanus church, a late gothic church
dating back to 1479 with a magnificent organ. The former Municipal
Building is situated on The Market Place. Constituted between 1500
and 1550 it houses a large collection of weapons, amongst which one
of the largest collection of black powder guns (haakhussen) in the
whole world should be mentioned.

Furthermore there is a corn windmill `The Swallow', dating back to
1748 as well as the `Stenendijk', a unique embankment and the last
shell limekiln in Europe still in full operation.

The city center with the townmoat adorned by lime-trees, the Van
Stolkspark and the hustle and bustle at the docks are ideally suited
for a stroll.

The area around Hasselt is also worth mentioning. In wintertime
polder Mastenbroek harbours large numbers of geese. In summertime the
hamlets Genne, Streukel and Celle\-mui\-den form, together with the very
rare lapwing flowers (Lat. Fritillaria meleagris) found on the banks
of the river Zwatewater, the ideal surroundings for walking or
cycling trips.

Hasselt also is a very important center for watersports. The lakes of
northwest Overijssel, the river IJssel, the Overijsselse Vecht and
the Randmeren are within easy reach from the yacht harbour `De
Molenwaard'. Sailing, fishing, swimming and canoeing can be fully
enjoyed in Hasselt.

Furthermore some events of special interest should be
mentioned. Every year at the end of August Hasselt celebrates the
`Eui Festival' (hay festival).
