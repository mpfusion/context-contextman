activated by:

\starttyping

On a black and white printer you will see only grey shades.
In an electronic document these colors will be as expected.

You can define your own colors with:

\shortsetup{definecolor}

For example:

\startbuffer
\definecolor[darkred]   [r=.5,g=.0,b=.0]
\definecolor[darkgreen] [r=.0,g=.5,b=.0]
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer

Now the colors \type{darkred} and \type{darkgreen} are
available.
