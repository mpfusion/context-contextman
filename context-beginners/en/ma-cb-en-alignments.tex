Horizontal and vertical alignment can be set up with:

\shortsetup{setupalign}

Single lines can be aligned with:

\starttyping
\rightaligned{}
\leftaligned{}
\midaligned{}
\stoptyping

\startbuffer
\leftaligned  {Hasselt was built on a sandhill.}
\midaligned   {Hasselt was built on the crossing of two rivers.}
\rightaligned {Hasselt's name stems from hazelwood.}
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer

After processing this would look like:

\getbuffer

Alignment of a paragraph is done with:

\shortsetup{startalignment}

In case of alignment you can specify a tolerance and the
direction (vertical or horizontal). Normally the tolerance
is \type{verystrict}. In colums you could specify
\type{verytolerant}. The tolerance in this manual is:

\starttyping
\setuptolerance[horizontal,verystrict]
\stoptyping

\stopcomponent
