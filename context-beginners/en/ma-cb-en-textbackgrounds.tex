\Command{\tex{starttextbackground}}

To emphasize a section you can use backgrounds. A
background is set with the command pair:

%\shortsetup{startbackground}
\shortsetup{starttextbackground}

An example can illustrate the use:

%% \startbuffer
%% \setupbackground[background=screen,corner=round]

%% \startbackground
%% Hasselt has produced a number of well known people. Only recently
%% it turned out that Kilian van Rensselaer played a prominent role
%% in the foundation of the State of New York.
%% \stopbackground
\startbuffer
\setuptextbackground[corner=round,frame=off,location=paragraph,
  leftoffset=.5\bodyfontsize,rightoffset=.5\bodyfontsize]

\starttextbackground
Hasselt has produced a number of well known people. Only recently
it turned out that Kilian van Rensselaer played a prominent role
in the foundation of the State of New York.
\stoptextbackground
\stopbuffer

\typebuffer

This would be displayed as:

\getbuffer

Backgrounds can span multiple pages. With:

%\shortsetup{setupbackground}
\shortsetup{setuptextbackground}

you can vary the display of the backgrounds.
