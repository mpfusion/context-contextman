\CONTEXT\ is a document engineering system based on \TEX.
\TEX\ is a typesetting system and a programming language to
typeset and produce documents. \CONTEXT\ is easy to use and
enables you to make complex paper and electronic documents.

This manual describes the capabilities of \CONTEXT, the
available commands and their functionality.\footnote{All
paper and electronic products around \CONTEXT\ are produced
with \CONTEXT. All sources of these products are or will be
made available electronically to give you insight in the way

\CONTEXT\ is developed for practical applications: the
typesetting and production of documents ranging from simple
straight forward books up to very complex and advanced
technical manuals and textbooks in a paper or an electronic
version. This introductory manual describes the \CONTEXT\
functionality necessary to apply standard text elements in a
manual or textbook. \CONTEXT, however, is capable of much
more and for users who want more there are other \CONTEXT\
manuals and sources available.

work with \CONTEXT\ in their own language. \CONTEXT\ and
this manual are available in Dutch, German, English and Czech.
