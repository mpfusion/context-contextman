\index{graphical features}

The graphical possibilities of \TEX||related macro packages
are rather limited. However by using the graphical package
\METAPOST\ of John Hobby a complete range of graphical
features has become available that may improve the look of
your documents.

In \CONTEXT\ there is a direct link to \METAPOST\ so users
can apply the features of \METAPOST\ directly into their
documents. The chapter headers and page numbers of this
manual are extended by some graphical elements that are
generated by \METAPOST.

The usage and features of \METAPOST\ within \CONTEXT\ are
described in the extensive \METAFUN\ manual.
