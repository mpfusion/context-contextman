 "Context Reference"

In this preliminary, still very incomplete, version the following
english language manuals are included / merged:

  * The Big Manual
  * Fonts
  * Columns sets
  * Processing modes
  * Texmfstart
  * Hyphenation patterns

You should be able to go to the 'en' directory and run 'make'.
If this gives errors for the 'fonts' chapter, you have add the
contents of 'texmf' to the font search path.
